I would like to thank Dr. Carsten Eickhoff for his continuous support, insightful and straightforward advice, positive criticism, proofreading, and the supervision of my master thesis. It has been a pleasure working with him.

Additionally, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Thomas Hofmann for giving me the opportunity to investigating the highly interesting topics of NLP and word embeddings, and for his valuable feedback.

Furthermore, I would like to thank everyone who supported me during my studies, especially my family, my business partners and colleagues\footnote{\url{https://www.renuo.ch}}, for their support, understanding, and positive attitude.

Finally, I would like to thank Marion for her continuous positive attitude, proofreading, and for being by my side.
